chat bot(chatting with robot)--

this is a sentence.---different words

"this"---word--token/single
"is"
"a"
"sentence"

data collection>>text pairsing>>text filtering>>text transformation>>text mining
1.we can collect data froma any website using webscraping ,or we can also use past data.
where ---it is the process extracting the text from any website using http or any web browser.
protocol---set of rules--
bluetooth,wifi
web browser--chrome driver.

buy-2
----
document--each row of unstructure data is called document

	tweet1	tweet2	tweet3
term1	0	3	5
term2
term3

tdm--term document matrix

	term1	term2	term3
